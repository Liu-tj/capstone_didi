## Data
Nov 2016, Chengdu City Second Ring Road Regional Trajectory Data Set

[Link](https://outreach.didichuxing.com/appEn-vue/personal?id=2)
* The trip request and trajectory data covers the period from passenger pick-up to drop-off.  
* The en-route time for pick-up is not included in the data.  However, this is not a big issue as orders are only matched to drivers within a certain radius, so there wasnâ€™t any super long pick-ups.
* DiDi has a pool service, and the datset covers them as well
